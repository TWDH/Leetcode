## Cover Letter

```
Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is He Zhu, a Master’s graduate from the University of Ottawa, majoring in Electrical computer engineering. My concentration is in Computer Engineering.

Upon learning about the Software Engineer posting with Enterprise Solution INC, I was eager to contact you with my interest. When reviewing the job description, I was excited to see how well my experience aligns with your company's needs and position requirements. From reading your company's website, I feel your core mission and culture suit what I offer as a professional.

As an adept Software Engineer, I have a well-rounded skill set in back-end development and honed talents in full-stack development (SpringBoot, SpringCloud frameworks, Vue.js, and database operations), making me an ideal fit for the Software Developer position. 

In terms of work experience, I have worked for Qualcomm as a Junior Software Engineer, cork office in 2017, and was responsible for the development of the back-end meeting management system (RBAC pattern).

I am excited at the prospect of bringing my talents to Enterprise Solution INC. I look forward to hearing from you, at your earliest convenience, to discuss how my experience and qualifications will prove valuable in the Software Developer role.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
He Zhu
