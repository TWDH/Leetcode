https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/50-popular-sql-interview-questions-for-testers/

## 1. What is SQL?

**Answer:** Structured Query Language SQL is a database tool that is used to create and access the database to support software applications.

## 2. What are the different types of statements supported by SQL?

**Answer:**

[![statements supported by SQL](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/statements-supported-by-SQL.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/statements-supported-by-SQL.jpg)

-  **DDL (Data Definition Language):** 
  - It is used to define the database structure such as tables. It includes three statements such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** 
  - These statements are used to manipulate the data in records. Commonly used DML statements are INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** 
  - These statements are used to set privileges such as GRANT and REVOKE database access permission to the specific user**.**

## 3. DISTINCT statement? 

**Answer:** The DISTINCT statement is used with the SELECT statement. If the record contains duplicate values then the DISTINCT statement is used to select different values among duplicate records.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name(s) FROM table_name;
```

##  3. different Clauses used in SQL?

![Clauses used in SQL](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Clauses-used-in-SQL.jpg)

**WHERE**: define the condition

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition;
```

**GROUP BY**: It is used with SELECT statement to group the result of the executed query using the value specified in it. It matches the value with the column name in tables and groups the end result accordingly.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```

**HAVING**: This clause is used in association with the GROUP BY clause. It is applied to each group of results or the entire result as a single group. It is much similar as WHERE clause but the only difference is you cannot use it without GROUP BY clause

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
GROUP BY column_name 
HAVING condition;
```

**ORDER BY**: This clause is used to define the order of the query output either in ascending (ASC) or in descending (DESC). Ascending (ASC) is set as the default one but descending (DESC) is set explicitly.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition 
ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
```

**USING**: USING clause comes in use while working with SQL JOIN. It is used to check equality based on columns when tables are joined. It can be used instead of the ON clause in JOIN.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
JOIN table_name 
USING (column_name);
```

## 4. SQL constraints?

- Constraints are defined while creating the database itself with the `CREATE TABLE` statement
- `ALTER TABLE` statement.

**There are 5 major constraints are used in SQL, such as**

- **NOT NULL:** 
  - That indicates that the column must have some value and cannot be left NULL.
- **UNIQUE:** 
  - This constraint is used to ensure that each row and column has a unique value and no value is being repeated in any other row or column.
- **PRIMARY KEY:** 
  - This constraint is used in association with `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints such as on one or the combination of more than one column to identify the particular record with a unique identity.
  - 主键约束是一个列或者列的组合，其值能**唯一地标识表中的每一行**，，且不能为 NULL，这样的一列或多列称为表的主键
- **FOREIGN KEY (外键约束):** 
  - It is used to ensure the referential integrity of data in the table. It matches the value in one table with another using the PRIMARY KEY. 它用于确保表中数据的引用完整性。它使用 `PRIMARY KEY` 将一个表中的值与另一个表中的值匹配。
- **CHECK:** 
  - It ensures whether the value in columns fulfills the specified condition.

## 5. Different JOINS used in SQL?

![SQL Joins](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/SQL-Joins.jpg)

![image-20210709223427823](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210709223427823.png)

- `on` 不会筛选主表信息,  `where` 会筛选主表信息,   如果在left或right join后使用where条件子句，那么它的效果和inner就一样了，不再是left，right join

- **INNER JOIN:** 求两个表的交集

  - It is also known as SIMPLE JOIN which returns all rows from BOTH tables when it has at least one matching column.

  - ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s) 
    FROM table_name1&nbsp;
    INNER JOIN table_name2 
    ON column_name1=column_name2;
    ```

  - **For Example,**

    In this example, we have a table **Employee** with the following data:

    [![Employee table](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)

    The second table’s name is **Joining.**

    [![joining](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining.jpg)

    **Enter the following SQL statement:**

    ```sql
    SELECT Employee.Emp_id, Joining.Joining_Date
    FROM Employee
    INNER JOIN Joining
    ON Employee.Emp_id = Joining.Emp_id
    ORDER BY Employee.Emp_id;
    ```

    There will be 4 records selected. **Results are:**

    [![result of innerjoin](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/result-of-innerjoin.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/result-of-innerjoin.jpg)

- **LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN):** 求两个表的交集外加左表剩下的数据

  - This join **returns** all rows from the **LEFT** table and its **matched rows** from a **RIGHT** table**.**

  - ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name1
    LEFT JOIN table_name2
    ON column_name1=column_name2;
    ```

  - **For Example,**

    In this example, we have a table **Employee** with the following data:

    [![Employee table](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)

    The second table’s name is **Joining.**

    [![joining 1](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining-1.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining-1.jpg)

    **Enter the following SQL statement:**

    ```sql
    SELECT Employee.Emp_id, Joining.Joining_Date
    FROM Employee
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Joining
    ON Employee.Emp_id = Joining.Emp_id
    ORDER BY Employee.Emp_id;
    ```

    There will be 4 records selected. **You will see the following results:**

    左表：Employee

    右表：Joining

    [![result of LEFT OUTER JOIN](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/result-of-LEFT-OUTER-JOIN.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/result-of-LEFT-OUTER-JOIN.jpg)

- **RIGHT JOIN**: 

  - This joins returns all rows from the RIGHT table and its matched rows from the LEFT table**.**

  - ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name1
    RIGHT JOIN table_name2
    ON column_name1=column_name2;
    ```

  - **For Example,**

    In this example, we have a table **Employee** with the following data:

    [![Employee table](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/Employee-table-1.jpg)

    The second table’s name is **Joining.**

    [![joining table](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining-1.jpg)](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2016/07/joining-1.jpg)

    **Enter the following SQL statement:**

    ```sql
    SELECT Employee.Emp_id, Joining.Joining_Date FROM Employee
    RIGHT JOIN Joining
    ON Employee.Emp_id = Joining.Emp_id
    ORDER BY Employee.Emp_id;
    ```

    **Output:**

    | Emp_id | Joining_Date |
    | :----- | :----------- |
    | E0012  | 2016/04/18   |
    | E0013  | 2016/04/19   |
    | E0014  | 2016/05/01   |

## 6. What are transactions (事务) and their controls?

- A transaction can be defined as the **sequence task** that is performed on databases in a logical manner to gain certain results
- Transaction means a **group of SQL** queries executed on database records.

**There are 4 transaction controls such as**

- **COMMIT**: 
  - It is used to save all changes made through the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: 
  - It is used to roll back the transaction. All changes made by the transaction are reverted back and the database remains as before.
- **SET TRANSACTION**: 
  - Set the name of the transaction.
- **SAVEPOINT:** 
  - It is used to set the point where the transaction is to be rolled back.

## 7. What are the properties of the transaction?

###  **ACID** properties. 

- ==Atomicity==: 
  - Ensures the completeness of all transactions performed. Checks whether every transaction is completed successfully or not. If not, then the transaction is aborted at the failure point and the **previous transaction is rolled back to its initial state** as changes are undone.
  - 事务是不可分割的整体，要么全执行，要么全不执行
- ==Consistency==: 
  - Ensures that all changes made through successful transactions are reflected properly on the database.
  - 一个事务执行前和执行后，数据库必须保持一致性状态
  - 最终一致性（银行案例）
- ==Isolation==: 
  - Ensures that all transactions are performed independently and changes made by one transaction are not reflected on others.
  - 2个事务不会互相影响
- ==Durability==: 
  - Ensures that the changes made in the database with committed transactions persist as it is even after a system failure.
  - 事物结束后，不会丢失
  - 事务没有提交，恢复到原状
  - 事务一旦提交(commit)，持久化到数据库

### 事务的隔离级别

- **脏读 (dirty read)**
  - 一个事务，读取了另一个事务，没有提交的数据。 (读了别人的)
- **不可重复读 (unrepeatable read)**
  - 一个事务，读取同一行数据，多次读取结果不同（事务未提交 -> 事务已经提交，不一定是错误）
- **幻读（虚读）(phantom read)**
  - 在一个事务内，读取到了别的事务插入的数据，导致前后读取不一致。（读自己的，别人插入我）

##  8. What is SQL Injection?

- 通过把SQL命令插入到Web表单，递交 或 输入域名 或 页面请求 的查询字符串，最终达到欺骗服务器执行恶意的SQL命令
- A type of database attack technique where malicious SQL statements are **inserted into an entry field of database**
- Once it is executed, the database is exposed to an attacker for the attack
- ![image-20210709225502555](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210709225502555.png)

## 9. Cartesian product of the table?

- The output of Cross Join is called a Cartesian product. It returns rows combining each row from the first table with each row of the second table. 
- **For Example,** if we join two tables having 15 and 20 columns the Cartesian product of two tables will be 15×20=300 rows.
- ![image-20210630155608415](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210630155608415.png)

## 10.  What do you mean by Subquery?

- Query within another query is called as Subquery. A subquery is called inner query which **returns output that is to be used by another query**.
- ![mysql_10_snap_04](http://justcode.ikeepstudying.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/mysql_10_snap_04.png)

## 11. How many row comparison operators are used while working with a subquery?

- 3-row comparison operators that are used in subqueries such as **IN**, **ANY** and **ALL**.

## 12. What is Normalization?

- Normalization is used to organize the data in such a manner that data redundancy will never occur in the database and avoid insert, update and delete anomalies.
- https://blog.csdn.net/Dreamhai/article/details/106563940

**There are 5 forms of Normalization:**

- **First Normal Form (1NF):** 

  - **数据表的每列都是原子性的，也就是每个属性都是不可能再分割的最小数据单元**
  - 第一范式（1NF）：无重复的列
  - It removes all duplicate columns from the table. It creates a table for related data and identifies **unique column values**.
  - ![image-20210710095230131](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210710095230131.png)

- **First Normal Form (2NF):** 

  - 第二范式（2NF）：属性完全依赖于主键（消除部分子函数依赖）
  - 每个实例必须可以被**唯一区分**，`primary key`，存储各个实例的**唯一标识 (unique identification)**
  - **有主键，非主键字段依赖主键**。唯一性 ，**一个表只说明一个事物**。
  - Follows 1NF and creates and places data subsets in an individual table and defines the relationship between tables using the **primary key**.
  - ![image-20210710095309989](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210710095309989.png)

- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** 

  - **在满足第二范式的基础上，每个单元组不能传递依赖主键**

    **传递函数依赖**：设X,Y,Z是关系R中互不相同的属性集合，存在X→Y(Y !→X),Y→Z，则称Z传递函数依赖于X。

  - 要求一个数据库表中不包含：已在其它表中 **已包含的非主键字段**

  - 第三范式（3NF）：属性不依赖于其他非主属性（消除传递依赖）

  - 表的信息，如果能够被推导出来，就不应该单独的设计一个字段来存放

  - removes those columns which are not related through the primary key.

  - ![image-20210710095437357](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TWDH/Leetcode-From-Zero/pictures/img/image-20210710095437357.png)

- **Fourth Normal Form (4NF):** 

  - Follows 3NF and does not define multi-valued dependencies. 4NF is also known as BCNF.

## 13. What is a Relationship?

The relationship can be defined as the **connection between more than one table** in the database.

**There are 4 types of relationships:**

- One to One Relationship
- One to Many Relationship
- Many to One Relationship
- Many to Many Relationship

## 14. Stored Procedures?

- 提高效率，为 SQL 语句进行编译优化，存储在数据库服务器。用户指定 “存储过程” 的名称来执行
- 没有权限用户，在控制之下，间接的存取数据库
- A stored procedure is a collection of SQL statements that can be used as a function to access the database.
- We can create these stored procedures earlier before using it and can execute them wherever required by applying some conditional logic to it.

## 15. How many Aggregate functions are available in SQL?

- SQL Aggregate functions determine and calculate values from **multiple columns** in a table and return a single value.

**There are 7 aggregate functions in SQL:**

- **AVG():** Returns the average value from specified columns.
- **COUNT():** Returns number of table rows.
- **MAX():** Returns the largest value among the records.
- **MIN():** Returns smallest value among the records.
- **SUM():** Returns the sum of specified column values.
- **FIRST():** Returns the first value.
- **LAST():** Returns last value.

## 16. What are Scalar functions in SQL? SQL中的标量函数是什么?

**Answer:** Scalar functions are used to return a single value based on the input values.

**Scalar Functions are as follows:**

- **UCASE():** Converts the specified field in the upper case.
- **LCASE():** Converts the specified field in lower case.
- **MID():** Extracts and returns character from the text field.
- **FORMAT():** Specifies the display format.
- **LEN():** Specifies the length of the text field.
- **ROUND():** Rounds up the decimal field value to a number.

## 16. What are triggers?

**Answer:** Triggers in SQL is kind of stored procedures used to create a **response to a specific action** performed on the table such as INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE. You can invoke triggers explicitly on the table in the database.

- SQL中的触发器是用于创建对表上执行的特定操作的响应的存储过程，例如插入，更新或删除。 您可以在数据库中的表中明确调用触发器。

Action and Event are two main components of SQL triggers. When certain actions are performed, the event occurs in response to that action.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER name {BEFORE|AFTER} (event [OR..]}
ON table_name [FOR [EACH] {ROW|STATEMENT}]
EXECUTE PROCEDURE functionname {arguments}
```

## 17.What is View in SQL?

**Answer:** A View can be defined as a virtual table that contains rows and columns with fields from one or more tables.

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE condition
```

## 18. How we can update the view?

**Answer:** SQL `CREATE and REPLACE` can be used for updating the view.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
```

## 19. Explain the working of SQL Privileges?

**Answer:** SQL GRANT and REVOKE commands are used to implement privileges in SQL multiple user environments. The administrator of the database can grant or revoke privileges to or from users of database objects by using commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALL, etc.

**GRANT Command**: This command is used to provide database access to users other than the administrator.

```sql
GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO {user_name|PUBLIC|role_name}
[WITH GRANT OPTION];
```

In the above syntax, the GRANT option indicates that the user can grant access to another user too.

**REVOKE command**: This command is used to provide database deny or remove access to database objects.

```sql
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM {user_name|PUBLIC|role_name};
```

## 20. How many types of Privileges are available in SQL?

- **System privilege:** 
  - System privilege deals with the object of a particular type and provides users the right to perform one or more actions on it. These actions include **performing administrative tasks**, ALTER ANY INDEX, ALTER ANY CACHE GROUP CREATE/ALTER/DELETE TABLE, CREATE/ALTER/DELETE VIEW etc.
  - 系统权限处理特定类型的对象，并为用户提供对其执行一个或多个操作的权利。 这些操作包括执行管理任务，更改任何索引，更改任何缓存组创建/更改/删除表，创建/更改/删除视图等。
- **Object privilege:** 
  - This allows to perform actions on an object or object of another user(s) viz. table, view, indexes etc. Some of the object privileges are EXECUTE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, FLUSH, LOAD, INDEX, REFERENCES etc.
  - 这允许对另一个用户的对象或对象执行操作。 表，视图，索引等。一些对象权限是执行，插入，更新，删除，选择，刷新，加载，索引，参考等。

## 21. What is SQL Sandbox in SQL Server?

**Answer:** SQL Sandbox is a s**afe place in the SQL** server environment where untrusted scripts are executed. 

- **Safe Access Sandbox:** 
  - Here a user can perform SQL operations such as creating stored procedures, triggers etc. but cannot have access to the memory as well as cannot create files.
- **External Access Sandbox:** 
  - Users can access files without having the right to manipulate the memory allocation.
- **Unsafe Access Sandbox:** 
  - This contains untrusted codes where a user can have access to memory.

## 22.SQL and PL/SQL?

- SQL: Structured Query Language to create and access databases
- PL/SQL: comes with procedural concepts of programming languages.

## 23. SQL and MySQL?

-  SQL：a Structured Query Language that is used for manipulating and accessing the relational database.
- MySQL：a relational database that uses SQL as the standard database language.

## 24. What is the use of the NVL function?

- NVL function is used to **convert the null value to its actual value**.

## 25. clustered and non-clustered indexes?

- One table can have only one **clustered index** but **multiple non-clustered indexes**.
- **Clustered indexes** can be **read rapidly** rather than non-clustered indexes.
- **Clustered indexes** store data **physically** in the table or view whereas, **non-clustered indexes** do not store data in the table as it has separate structure from the data row.

## 26. DELETE and TRUNCATE?

- The basic difference in both is `DELETE` command is **DML (Data Manipulation Language)** command and the `TRUNCATE` command is **DDL (Data Definition Language)**.
- `DELETE` command is used to **delete a specific row** from the table whereas the `TRUNCATE` command is used to **remove all rows** from the table.
- We can use the `DELETE` command with `WHERE` clause but cannot use the TRUNCATE command with it.

## 27. DROP and TRUNCATE?

- TRUNCATE：**removes all rows** from the table which cannot be retrieved back
- DROP： **removes the entire table** from the database and it also cannot be retrieved back

## 28. How to write a query to show the details of a student from Students table whose name start with K?

```sql
SELECT * FROM Student WHERE Student_Name like ‘K%’;
```

- Here `‘like’` operator is used to perform pattern matching.

## 29. Nested Subquery and Correlated Subquery?

- **Answer:** 
  - Subquery **within another subquery** is called `Nested Subquery`.  
  - If the output of a subquery depends on column values of the parent query table then the query is called Correlated Subquery. 如果子查询的输出取决于父查询表的列值，则查询称为相关子查询

```sql
SELECT adminid(SELEC Firstname+' '+Lastname&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM Employee WHERE empid=emp. adminid) AS EmpAdminId FROM Employee;
```

The result of the query is the details of an employee from the Employee table.
