~~Hello Sir/madam, My name is He Zhu, graduated from University of Ottawa this year on May. My major is in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My learning interest is on computer engineering, to be more specific, java web development. I was also involved in an AI Research project during the university. The web development skill is the one I'd like to talk most, date back to my third-year internship, I worked in Qualcomm Cork office as a Junior Software Engineer.  At that time, my main responsibility was to work with the Quality Verification Team and Develop a full-stack Meeting Management System. I participated in configuring the continuous integration tool Jenkins and written automation test tool using python. For the Meeting management system,  I was chosen to be the small team leader in terms of arranging all the meetings and assignment. I mainly responsible for backend development, we used Spring Framework like SpringBoot to develop APIs. The project took us around two months and we were awarded Qualcomm Star for our great work. What's more, in the following years, I didn't stop myself from learning cutting-edge technologies and developed a few full-stack web app using modern frameworks, including SpringBoot, SpringCloud, Vue and so on. My favorite one is the online movie web, which is deployed on server using docker. It really plays movie if you’d like to try it. I'm looking forward to joining the company to make my contribution as an software engineer.~~

## 项目：在线视频 Online Movie Web App

The ~~first~~ project I’d like to introduce is a Online Movie Web application. It’s built on Spring Boot as the backend framework and Vue.js as the frontend framework. Basically the project is separated into two parts, the front page for customers and backstage management system for staff.

The project is implemented based on microservices using Spring Cloud, all the request from front-end will be route to a specific service by Spring Cloud Gateway. In terms of communication between different services, Nacos is used as a registration center, Feign is responsible for remote method invoking. Lastly, Hystrix is playing a important role of providing fault tolerance and latency tolerance. 降级页面

All the CRUD operation is done in the management system using Mybatis plus, to be more specific, it includes Artist CRUD, Movie CRUD,  Chapter, Episode CRUD and so on. All the movies’ cover and video itself are stored in the Aliyun which is pretty much like AWS.  Redis is used to improve the efficiency of getting the home page images, by caching all the data into the redis database. 

Besides, the system implemented JWT token based authorization and authentication security system. It was achieved using Spring Security Framework. The design follows the RBAC (role based access control) pattern. To make the system even secure and efficient, we store the “permission” information to the redis database. ~~in case someone knows the backend url including the username and password, it won’t let him in because he can not access to our redis information so that no “role” information will be returned.~~  

The whole project is packaged and deployed on server right now, all the microservices are packed individually and deployed using docker. You may also see in my resume that the link is next to the first project. Although the style may not that beautiful, but it can really play the video like a real website.



## 项目：在线商城 Online Shopping Web App

The purpose is to designed a large scale online shopping mall. 

The shopping mall web application has two parts, one for backend management system, and the other one is the webpage for customers.  The backend is implemented using SpringBoot and Vue. Features including the CRUD operations of items, different attributes, like sku and spu and item publishment. what’s more, it also store the membership, warehouse and order information. All of these function supports CRUD operations.  

In terms of the front pages for customers, I separate them into few different microservices, including authentication login system with OAuth2.0 weibo login，order system, warehouse system, seckill system, and online payment system. ElasticSearch is used for improving the search efficiency. I also implemented redis for protecting the Mysql database in case large number of queries coming inside and Database can not afford the pressure. For the order system, if encountering large sale festival like black Friday, loads of orders will come inside, I also designed a rabbit MQ to let the orders going into the Queue, waiting for the backend system to process the orders one by one, in the meanwhile, we can respond to our customers a lot quicker than directly communicating with the database. 

1. Your background. 
2. Programming Language: what does "final" mean in Java? Difference between reference and pointer in C++? 
3. Operating System: thread vs process? Heap vs Stack? Any projects? 
4. Database: ACID? What is Normalization? What is subquery? 
5. java and c, name of the networking layers, some data structure questions.

# 经典Java

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming?

- **Inheritance (继承)**: 
  - Inheritance is a process where one class **acquires the properties** of another.
- **Polymorphism (多态)**: 
  - Polymorphism is the ability of a **variable**, **function** or **object** to take multiple forms.
  - `Compile time` polymorphism
    - method overloading
  - `Run time` polymorphism
    - done using **inheritance** and **interface**.
- **Encapsulation (封装)**: 
  - Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of **wrapping up the data** and code together as a single unit.
  - **Data is hidden from the outer world** 将数据隐藏
  - Accessed only via current **class methods (getter, setter)** 只能用方法操作变量
  - **Abstraction (抽象)**: 
    - Abstraction is the methodology of **hiding the implementation details** from the user and only providing the functionality to the users. 

## 2. what is interface?

- A collection of **abstract method** and **static constant**
- method is **public** and **abstract**
- **No constructor**
- **No method** implementation
- Instance variable is **public static final**, has to initialize 
- Function don’t have to accumulate, because not good for maintenance

## 3. "final" mean in Java?

Non access modifier, used in different context

- **final variable**
  - **value cannot be changed**. only class constructor can assign to it 
  - **引用**不能改变，reference cannot be changed, 只能指向初始对象。（对象本身可以改变）
- **final method**
  - **can’t be overridden** by the **inheriting class**
  - subclass **can use** the method
- **final class**
  - **can’t be extended** by any **subclass**,  **can extend other class**. 
  - all method cannot be overridden
- final parameter
  - cannot be changed within the method

## 4. “static” mean in Java?

- **Static Instance Variable**
  - Global variable 全局变量，不会根据对象而修改
  - 属于 Class， 在内存中**只有一个内存地址**。只要类被加载，静态变量就被分配空间
  - `class.staticVariable` or `instance.staticVariable`
- **Static Method**
  - **Class Method**, 属于类方法，不是对象方法，不需要创建 Instance Variable 就可以使用
  - **Cannot** invoke **non-static method**，对象还没创建 or 不能确定是哪个对象的方法
  - **Singleton Pattern**, 创建对象的方法设为 static
    - 无法创建对象（构造器私有）
    - 必须用 `class.method` 创建对象
- **Static Code Block**
  - JVM load static code block when loading Class
  - 初始化静态变量
  - 执行一次
- **Static Inner Class**
  - not rely on outer instance initialization
  - no same name as outer class
  - 不能访问外部类的成员变量，但可以访问外部类的静态变量 or 方法

## 5. Heap and Stack

![img](https://snailclimb.gitee.io/javaguide/docs/java/jvm/pictures/java内存区域/Java运行时数据区域JDK1.8.png)

- 栈：**基本数据类型** + **对象引用变量**
- 堆：**引用类型的变量** (new 出来的对象)
- 线程间共享堆内存

| **Features** |                          **Stack**                           |                           **Heap**                           |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   *Memory*   | Stack memory is used only by **one thread of execution**. <br />(当前线程可以使用) | Heap memory is used by **all the parts of the application**. (全部应用可以使用) |
|   *Access*   | Stack memory **can’t** be accessed by **other threads.** <br />(其他线程不可使用) |   Objects stored in the heap are **globally accessible.**    |                                                            |
|  *Lifetime*  |   Exists until the **end of** execution of the **thread**.   | Heap memory lives from the start till the end of **application execution**. |
|   *Usage*    | Stack memory only contains **local primitive** and **reference variables** （指向一个object的地址）to objects in heap space. | Whenever an **object is created**, it’s always **stored** in the **Heap** space. |

## 6.overloading (重载) and overriding (重写)?

- **overloading** (重载)
  - same name 方法名一样
  - different # of parameters 变量数不同
  - different types 变量类型不同
  - different order 变量顺序不同
  - compile-time polymorphism 编译时多态
- **overriding** (重写)
  - subclass exactly same method 子类完全相同的方法
  -  “Change” existing behavior 改变父类中的方法
  - run-time polymorphism 运行时多态 

## Abstract class and interface

- 相同点
  - 不能被实例化
  - 只有实现接口，或实现抽象类中的方法，才可以被实例化
- 不同点
  - 接口：
    - 方法不能在接口中实现，只能定义方法 (Java8前)
    - 类可以实现多个接口
    - 强调特定功能，has a xxx
    - 功能不需要积累
    - 成员变量：public static final，静态 + 不可修改
    - 成员方法：public abstract
  - abstract类：
    - 抽象类可以定义方法实现
    - 类只能继承一个抽象类
    - 强调所属关系，is a xxx 
    - 功能需要积累

## 7. Error and Exception

- **Error**
  - An error is an **irrecoverable** condition occurring at runtime. 运行时问题，无法解决
  - OutOfMemory
- **Exception**
  - bad input 不正确认为失误，可以被解决
  - **Checked Exception** (Compile-time Exception)
    - Checked exceptions are **checked at compile-time**. 编译时检测
    -  classes that **extend `Throwable` class**
    - 除了  `RuntimeException` and `Error` 都是checked
    - 必须处理（try ...catch）的异常
    - Example: `IOException`, `SQLException` etc.
  - **Unchecked Exception** (Runtime Exception)
    - classes that **extend `RuntimeException`** 
    - Example: `ArithmeticException`, `NullPointerException` etc.

## 8. Processes and Threads?

- **Process (进程)**
  - Instance of a Program 程序实例
  - 通讯：**进程间** 通信 ( inter-process communication) 与 同级进程通信
  - 其他进程：不会影响子进程，只能控制子进程
  - 控制：操作系统控制进程
- **Thread (线程)**
  - subset of the process 进程子集，程序执行最小单元
  - 通讯：线程间可直接互相通讯
  - 其他线程：main 线程会影响其他线程，进程可以很大的控制线程
  - 控制：程序员控制线程
  - 每个线程，**共享内存空间**
  - 状态：运行、就绪、挂起、结束

## 7. What are the properties of the transaction?

###  **ACID** properties. 

- ==Atomicity==: 
  - Ensures the completeness of all transactions performed. Checks whether every transaction is completed successfully or not. If not, then the transaction is aborted at the failure point and the **previous transaction is rolled back to its initial state** as changes are undone.
  - 事务是不可分割的整体，要么全执行，要么全不执行
- ==Consistency==: 
  - Ensures that all changes made through successful transactions are reflected properly on the database.
  - 一个事务执行前和执行后，数据库必须保持一致性状态
  - 最终一致性（银行案例）
- ==Isolation==: 
  - Ensures that all transactions are performed independently and changes made by one transaction are not reflected on others.
  - 2个事务不会互相影响
- ==Durability==: 
  - Ensures that the changes made in the database with committed transactions persist as it is even after a system failure.
  - 事物结束后，不会丢失
  - 事务没有提交，恢复到原状
  - 事务一旦提交(commit)，持久化到数据库

### 事务的隔离级别

- **脏读 (dirty read)**
  - 一个事务，读取了另一个事务，没有提交的数据。 (读了别人的)
- **不可重复读 (unrepeatable read)**
  - 一个事务，读取同一行数据，多次读取结果不同（事务未提交 -> 事务已经提交，不一定是错误）
- **幻读（虚读）(phantom read)**
  - 在一个事务内，读取到了别的事务插入的数据，导致前后读取不一致。（读自己的，别人插入我）
